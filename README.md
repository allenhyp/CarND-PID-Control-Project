    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Reflections:

### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

First, the proportional component affect the steering most severely. It's like the "eagerness" of the car to push itself to the target. The more distance (error) that the car is away from the target, which means the CTE is large, the more the force would be apply onto the steering angle.

On the other hand, the differential component counteracts the P component's tendency to ring and overshoot the target. In other words, it would weaken the power generated by the first one. Eventually, it will smoothen the steering trajectory to approach the target without overshooting if properly tuned.

The integral component serves as a conteration of bias in the CTE that prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias, such as a steering drift, would be relatively small in the scinario of our project, and thus the I component should have a small weight compared to other components.

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Basically, I chose the parameters by trial and error. First, tune weight of the proportional component until the car ocillating by the center with an acceptable range. Then add the differential in order to adjust the overshooting. Finally, keeping the weght of the integral component close to zero would be fine. The final parameters I used were [P: 0.09, I: 0.006, D: 1.55].
